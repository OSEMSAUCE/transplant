# Table Implementation Instructions

## Overview

This document provides instructions for implementing a dynamic table with multiple headers, each representing a different stage of data processing.

## Table Structure

1. **Headers**: Each header represents a different component or stage in your data pipeline. These stages are `csv`, `transformed`, `mapped`, as defined in your state management. There are also headers components to toggle off irrelevant attributes and sort columns and filter.

2. **Components Above Headers**: Above each `<thead>`, you can have dropdowns and toggles. These components will allow you to transform data types, sort columns, and map them to the database.

3. **Dynamic Table**: The table should be dynamic, allowing for various actions on the data before pushing it to the database and recalling it for further modifications.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Define Table Headers**:

   - **CSV Header**: Display the raw CSV headers.
   - **Transformed Header**: Display headers after data transformation.
   - **Mapped Header**: Display headers mapped to the database schema.

2. **Create Components Above Headers**:

   - **Dropdowns**: For selecting data types or transformation options.
   - **Toggles**: For enabling/disabling certain features or sorting.

3. **State Management**:

   - Use the `$state` and `$derived` runes to manage the current stage and data.
   - Utilize the existing functions (`loadCsv`, `transform`, `mapColumns`) to handle data transitions between stages.

4. **UI Integration**:
   - Implement the table in your Svelte components, utilizing the state from `data.ts`.
   - Ensure that the UI updates dynamically based on the current stage.

## Organizing Table and Headers

### Approach 1: Single Route File with Headers as Components

- **Structure**:

  - Use a single route file, e.g., `+page.svelte`, to manage the overall page.
  - Create separate component files for each header type in the `src/lib/components` directory.

- **Pros**:

  - **Modularity**: Each header is encapsulated in its own component, making it easier to manage and update independently.
  - **Reusability**: Headers can be reused across different tables or pages if needed.
  - **Simplified Routing**: Only one route file to manage, reducing complexity in routing logic.

- **Cons**:
  - **Component Overhead**: May introduce additional complexity if there are too many small components.
  - **Inter-Component Communication**: Managing state and data flow between the main page and components might require additional effort.

### Approach 2: New File for Each Table/Header Combo

- **Structure**:

  - Create separate files for each table/header combination, possibly including both the table and its headers in the same file.

- **Pros**:

  - **Isolation**: Each table/header combo is self-contained, reducing dependencies.
  - **Customization**: Easier to customize each table/header combo specifically for its use case.

- **Cons**:
  - **Duplication**: Potential for code duplication if similar logic is repeated across files.
  - **Maintenance**: More files to manage, which can become cumbersome as the project grows.

### Approach 3: Component for the Table and Routes for Each Header

- **Structure**:

  - Create a component for the table itself, and have different routes for each header type.

- **Pros**:

  - **Separation of Concerns**: Clearly separates the table logic from the header logic.
  - **Dynamic Routing**: Allows for dynamic loading and rendering of headers based on the route.

- **Cons**:
  - **Complex Routing**: Requires more complex routing logic to handle different headers.
  - **State Management**: Managing shared state between routes and components can be challenging.

### Recommendation

Given the requirements and complexity, **Approach 1** is recommended. It provides modularity and reusability without overly complicating the routing logic. Headers' logic can be encapsulated in components, and the overall page managed in a single route file.

## Reducing Complexity with Components

To manage complexity, especially in large Svelte files, consider using the following strategies:

- **Componentization**: Break down complex files into smaller, reusable components. For example, you can create separate components for each header type and the main table. This modular approach makes it easier to manage and update the code.

- **Three Headers per Route**: You can have three headers per route on the same table, with each header being its own component. This way, headers are not nested within the table but have their own relationship to it, simplifying the structure.

- **Separation of Concerns**: Move data processing and business logic into separate utility functions or services. This separation ensures that UI components focus solely on rendering and user interaction, making the codebase more maintainable.

- **Centralized State Management**: Use a centralized state management solution or context to manage application state, reducing the need for multiple state variables scattered throughout the code.

Implementing these strategies will help in managing complexity, improving code readability, and enhancing maintainability. This approach aligns with the recommended strategy of using components for headers and maintaining a clear separation between UI and logic.

## Additional Notes

- Consider adding error handling and validation to ensure data integrity throughout the stages.
- Keep the user interface intuitive and responsive for better user experience.
